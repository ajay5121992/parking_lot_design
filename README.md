7. Parking_Alocation: This class initializes the parking lot with providing number of floor and slots
and perform the basic designated functionality of adding, removing and listing vehicles with the linkage of other classes specified above.


Driver_file.py:- 
File test the code of Parking_Lot_Design by initalizing the Parking_Alocation class with number of floor and number of slots each floor(level has).
Perform the necessary opertion of adding, removing and listing company vehicles.
Functions defined are:
1. inserting_vehicle :- This function performs the insertion operation and uses the "Park_vehicle",
function from  Parking_Allocation class which take Vehicle entity as input ex Car(1,'Airtel').
